# Music_Genre_Recognition

This project was created as a part of subject ''Processing and Recognition of Sounds''. The aim of this project was to investigate the current state of the art in music genre recognition without usage of any neural networks. The project was created basing on following articles:
1. Klaus Seyerlehner, Gerhard Widmer, and Peter Knees. ”Acomparison of human, automatic and collaborative musicgenre classification and user centric evaluation of genreclassification systems.'' 
2. Costa, Yandre MG, et al. ”Music genre recognition usingspectrograms''

The first article is a comparision of classifying made by comupter and a group of people. The program consisted from a few different classifiers which were aggregated finally.

The second article bases on analysing spectrograms as a tool to recognize specific music genres.

Project is a combination of both ideas and was tested on dataset ''Annotated'' made by Karl Seyerlehner.
